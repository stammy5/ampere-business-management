# üîß **Xero Integration Connection Fix**

## **‚úÖ Issues Fixed**

### **1. Database Foreign Key Constraint Issue**
**Problem**: The Xero integration was failing to save tokens due to a foreign key constraint violation in the `createdById` field.

**Root Cause**: The `XeroService.saveTokensToDatabase()` method was hardcoding `'system'` as the `createdById`, but no user with that ID existed in the database.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `XeroService` constructor to accept `userId` parameter
- Modified `saveTokensToDatabase()` to use the actual user ID instead of `'system'`
- Updated all API endpoints to pass the current user's ID to `XeroService`

### **2. Missing Error Handling & Logging**
**Problem**: Limited visibility into connection failures and authentication issues.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added comprehensive logging to track the OAuth flow
- Enhanced error handling in callback processing  
- Added detailed status information in API responses

### **3. Redirect URI Configuration**
**Problem**: Potential issues with redirect URI configuration for different environments.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated Xero config to use `NEXTAUTH_URL` as fallback for redirect URI
- Better handling of environment-specific URLs

## **üîç How to Test the Fix**

### **Step 1: Check Xero Status**
1. Log into the application
2. Go to **Settings** page  
3. Find the **Xero Integration** section
4. Click **Check Status** or view the integration status

### **Step 2: Connect to Xero**
1. Click **"Connect to Xero"** button
2. You should be redirected to Xero's authorization page
3. Log into your Xero account and authorize the connection
4. You'll be redirected back to the settings page with a success/error message

### **Step 3: Verify Connection**
1. The status should show "Connected" with your organization name
2. Try the **"Test Connection"** button to verify API access
3. Check if sync features are working

## **üêõ Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Issue: "Failed to save integration settings"**
**Cause**: Database constraint or permission issue
**Solution**: 
- Check that you're logged in with a valid user account
- Verify database connection is working
- Check server logs for specific database errors

### **Issue: "Xero credentials not configured"** 
**Cause**: Missing environment variables
**Solution**: Verify these environment variables are set in `.env`:
```env
XERO_CLIENT_ID="71C201203893448AA87867F089F938B2"
XERO_CLIENT_SECRET="C3g9DQQfddSRmG4wKkcabTC-MeDf710IOMOY9P171XRD_RvQ"  
XERO_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3000/api/xero/callback"
XERO_SCOPES="accounting.transactions accounting.contacts accounting.settings"
```

### **Issue: "Failed to connect to Xero: Invalid or expired tokens"**
**Cause**: Token refresh failed or tokens are corrupted
**Solution**:
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting to Xero
- Clear any existing Xero integration records from database
- Check Xero app permissions in your Xero developer console

### **Issue: "No Xero organisation found"**
**Cause**: User doesn't have access to any Xero organizations
**Solution**:
- Ensure you're logging into the correct Xero account
- Verify you have appropriate permissions in the Xero organization
- Check that the organization is active

## **üîß Technical Details**

### **Files Modified**:
- `lib/xero-service.ts` - Added user ID parameter and better error handling
- `lib/xero-config.ts` - Improved redirect URI handling  
- `app/api/xero/auth/route.ts` - Added configuration validation
- `app/api/xero/callback/route.ts` - Enhanced logging and error handling
- `app/api/xero/status/route.ts` - Updated to pass user ID
- `app/api/xero/test/route.ts` - Updated to pass user ID

### **Database Schema**: 
The `XeroIntegration` table structure:
```sql
model XeroIntegration {
  id             String    @id
  tenantId       String    @unique  
  tenantName     String?
  accessToken    String
  refreshToken   String
  expiresAt      DateTime
  scopes         String[]
  isActive       Boolean   @default(true)
  connectedAt    DateTime  @default(now())
  lastSyncAt     DateTime?
  createdById    String    -- Now properly references User.id
  User           User      @relation(fields: [createdById], references: [id])
}
```

### **OAuth Flow**:
1. User clicks "Connect to Xero" 
2. `/api/xero/auth` generates authorization URL
3. User authorizes on Xero's website
4. Xero redirects to `/api/xero/callback` with authorization code
5. Service exchanges code for access/refresh tokens
6. Tokens are saved to database with proper user association
7. Connection is tested immediately
8. User is redirected back with success/error status

## **üîç Server Logs**

When testing, check the server console for detailed logs:
- "Generated Xero auth URL: ..." - Authorization URL created
- "Processing Xero callback with code: ..." - OAuth callback received  
- "Token response received: ..." - Token exchange status
- "Tenants found: X" - Number of Xero organizations found
- "Saving tokens to database..." - Database save attempt
- "Xero connection test result: ..." - Final connection test

---

## **‚úÖ Expected Behavior After Fix**

1. **Successful Connection**: Status shows "Connected" with organization name
2. **Token Storage**: Tokens are properly saved in `XeroIntegration` table
3. **Test Connection**: API calls to Xero work successfully  
4. **Auto-Refresh**: Tokens are automatically refreshed when needed
5. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for any connection issues

The Xero integration should now work reliably for connecting, storing credentials, and maintaining the connection with proper token refresh handling.
